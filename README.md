These are some experiments that I'm doing with the electro-smith Daisy Patch.

Nothing too crazy yet but figured I should have my own repo to play in.

## TODO
* Rename/refactor from chords to supersaw. Update Readme.
* Add high pass filter for supersaw.
* Plumb in trigger for reset
* Make 4th CV assignable
* Create supersaw/pulse blend with variable blend
  * Create PWM param for pulse
